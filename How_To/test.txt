pre_load every type of img ?
	less calls of mlx_xpm_file_to_img
how to store them ?
struct
or -> stock every type of addr to char **
each line is a addr
just have to remember which line is which


so

OR ?!

instead of stocking paths into char*-img
store the addr
	that might do it yeah
(one call of xpm_to_img per img at the begining and BAM, easy)
