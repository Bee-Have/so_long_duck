so basically :

load img with : mlx_xpm_tile_to_image;
then print : mlx_put_image_to_window;

(will have to calculate where to put map on window depending on size)
(look at visualizer push_swap)

basically :
load map first :
	load water tile -> print it everywhere;
	load walls -> print it by reading map
	load objs -> print it by reading map
	load exit -> print it by reading map
	load pj -> print it by reading map


send all "map_info" && "mls_info" to function
while (map[row] != NULL)
{
	while (map[row][collumn] != '\0')
	{
		img = floor tile
		print img
		if (map == 1)
			img = //function that returns tile (depending on which side we are on)
		else if (map == C)
			img = sprite of obj
		else if (map == E)
			img = exit
		else if (map == P)
			img = pj
		print img
		collumn++;
	}
	collumn = 0;
	row++;
}
