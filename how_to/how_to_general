parse the map given as argument

check if the map is correct
	if not return error

init the mlx
depending on what you read on the map :
	1 : render wall
	0 : render floor
	C : render collectible
	E : render map exit
	P : render player

all of these will be paths in struct

how do we render sprites ?

-----------------------------------------------------

render tests :

init mlx

try to render img
how to deal with sets of sprites ?
how do we read them ?
also need to transform all png to xpm (hurgh)
"xpm tp img" doesn't seem to make a difference between the tiles
i will have to separate them all on my own

so basically :
if animation :
	read the same file multiple time (defined number of times)
	then change image and repeat
if other :
	simply read the image;

so i have to separate images now ?
fuck that sucks
